# multifocus-image-fusion-
this is the matlab code for the paper "sparse representation based multifocus image fusion in spatial domain"

the method mainly contains the following two steps:

(1) use sparse representation(max L1 rule) to get an initial decision map

(2) considering the consistency of the focused region, we use morphorlogical filtering to  get the final decision map for fusion
